			Access levels

*access specifiers and access modifiers both are same.

1. We can have control over the data, which one should be shared and which one should not be over package structure.

2. The access specifiers in java maintais the accessibility or scope of a field, method, constructors or class

private || default || protected || public

3. default == package == friendly

4. The private members can be access within the class only

5. The scope of private member is within the declared class.

6. private members cannot be accessed outside of the class.

[1.In one java file any number classes can be developed.
 2. For all the classes a class file will be generated(after the successful compilation of java(file) eg: A.class, B.class, C.class )]

				 default   private   protected	 public
same class			  yes	     yes	yes	  yes
same package sub class	          yes	      no	yes	  yes
same package non-sub class	  yes	      no	yes	  yes
different package sub class	  no	      no	yes	  yes
different package non-sub class   no	      no	no	  yes
