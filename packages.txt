			Packages in java

1. Package in java used to group related classes.
2. By using packages we can avoid naming conflicts.
3. By usng packate we can achieve access protection.

4.first package declaration then only import statement
5. '.' represents current directory
6. In eclipse we can create multiple package using '.'
7.without package it will create class file in classes without directory

8.while object creation, with class name we have to mention classpath.
eg: com.lara.students.StudentsData sd1 = new (file address)com.lara.students.StudentsData();
when we are using package no need of using file address

9. In package, the class we are accessing it must be public.
