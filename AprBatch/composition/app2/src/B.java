/*
1. Inheritance: In Java, classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes. For example, a "Car" class can inherit attributes like "color" and "speed" from a more general "Vehicle" class.

2. Composition: Composition is a strong relationship where one class contains an instance of another class. For instance, a "Car" class may have a "Engine" class as one of its components.

3. Aggregation: Aggregation is a weaker form of composition where one class is associated with another class, but they can exist independently. An example is a "Department" class that contains multiple "Employee" instances.

4. Association: Association represents a relationship between two classes. It can be a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship. For example, a "Student" class can be associated with a "School" class in a one-to-one relationship.

5. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. For instance, a "Shape" class can have subclasses like "Circle" and "Rectangle," and both can be referred to as "Shape" objects.

6. Dependency: Dependency occurs when one class depends on another class, usually in terms of method parameters or local variables. For example, a "Car" class may depend on a "FuelPump" class to refuel.

7. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is a principle of wrapping data and methods within a class to control access and protect the internal state. It helps achieve data hiding and abstraction.

8. Association with Multiplicity: Association with multiplicity describes the number of instances that can be associated between two classes. For instance, a "Teacher" class can be associated with multiple "Student" instances in a one-to-many relationship.

9. Interface Implementation: In Java, a class can implement one or more interfaces, which defines a contract for the class to provide certain methods. For example, a "Rectangle" class can implement a "Drawable" interface, which requires it to have a "draw" method.

10. Method Overriding: Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in its superclass. This allows for specific behavior to be defined for each subclass. For instance, a "Cat" class can override the "makeSound" method inherited from the "Animal" superclass.

These are just a few examples of the relationships that can exist in Java, showcasing the various ways classes can interact and collaborate with each other.

 illustrate the "has-a" relationship using inheritance:

1. Animal and Dog Classes:
   The Dog class inherits from the Animal class, representing an "is-a" relationship. The Dog class has an instance variable called "breed" that represents a specific breed of dog.

2. Vehicle and Car Classes:
   The Car class inherits from the Vehicle class, representing an "is-a" relationship. The Car class has additional instance variables such as "model" and "year" that define specific attributes of a car.

3. Shape and Circle Classes:
   The Circle class inherits from the Shape class, representing an "is-a" relationship. The Circle class has a radius instance variable, defining a specific type of shape.

4. Bank and Account Classes:
   The Account class inherits from the Bank class, representing an "is-a" relationship. The Account class has additional instance variables like "accountNumber" and "balance" that define specific attributes of an account within a bank.

5. Person and Employee Classes:
   The Employee class inherits from the Person class, representing an "is-a" relationship. The Employee class has additional instance variables like "employeeId" and "salary" that define specific attributes of an employee.

6. University and Student Classes:
   The Student class inherits from the University class, representing an "is-a" relationship. The Student class has additional instance variables like "studentId" and "major" that define specific attributes of a student within a university.

7. Book and Novel Classes:
   The Novel class inherits from the Book class, representing an "is-a" relationship. The Novel class has additional instance variables like "genre" and "author" that define specific attributes of a novel.

8. Shape and Triangle Classes:
   The Triangle class inherits from the Shape class, representing an "is-a" relationship. The Triangle class has additional instance variables like "base" and "height" that define specific attributes of a triangle.

9. Employee and Manager Classes:
   The Manager class inherits from the Employee class, representing an "is-a" relationship. The Manager class has additional instance variables like "department" and "responsibilities" that define specific attributes of a manager.

10. Animal and Bird Classes:
    The Bird class inherits from the Animal class, representing an "is-a" relationship. The Bird class has additional instance variables like "wingSpan" and "canFly" that define specific attributes of a bird.

In each of these examples, the derived class (subclass) inherits the properties and methods of the base class (superclass), and also adds additional attributes specific to its own behavior. This relationship allows objects of the subclass to access and utilize the features of the superclass, promoting code reuse and creating a hierarchical structure.

1. Car and Engine Classes:
```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;
    
    public Car() {
        engine = new Engine();
    }
    
    // Other methods and attributes
}

public class Engine {
    // Engine implementation
}
```

    private Animal animal;
    
    public Zoo() {
        animal = new Animal();
    }
    
    // Other methods and attributes
}

public class Animal {
    // Animal implementation
}
```

9. School and Student Classes:
```java
public class School {
    private Student student;
    
    public School() {
        student = new Student();
    }
    
    // Other methods and attributes
}

public class Student {
    // Student implementation
}
```

10. MobilePhone and Battery Classes:
```java
public class MobilePhone {
    private Battery battery;
    
    public MobilePhone() {
        battery = new Battery();

inheritance vs composition in java brief explaination with 10 exaples on both with explaination
ChatGPT
In Java, both inheritance and composition are mechanisms for establishing relationships between classes. Here's a brief explanation of inheritance and composition, along with 10 examples (5 for each) to illustrate their differences:

Inheritance:
- Inheritance is an "is-a" relationship, where one class (subclass) derives properties and behaviors from another class (superclass).
- The subclass extends the superclass, inheriting its attributes, methods, and behavior.
- It promotes code reuse and supports hierarchical relationships.

Examples of Inheritance:

1. Animal and Dog Classes:
   The Dog class extends the Animal class, inheriting its general characteristics and behaviors while adding specific behaviors for dogs.

2. Shape and Circle Classes:
   The Circle class extends the Shape class, inheriting common shape properties and methods, and adds specific properties related to circles.

3. Employee and Manager Classes:
   The Manager class extends the Employee class, inheriting common employee attributes and methods, and adds additional attributes specific to managers.

4. Vehicle and Car Classes:
   The Car class extends the Vehicle class, inheriting shared vehicle properties and methods, and adds specific attributes and behaviors for cars.

5. Fruit and Apple Classes:
   The Apple class extends the Fruit class, inheriting basic fruit properties and methods, and adds additional attributes and behaviors specific to apples.

Composition:
- Composition is a "has-a" relationship, where one class contains an instance of another class as one of its components.
- It allows building complex objects by combining simpler objects.
- It supports flexibility and code reuse by providing a way to dynamically change the composition of objects.

Examples of Composition:

1. Car and Engine Classes:
   The Car class has an instance of the Engine class, allowing a car to contain and utilize an engine.

2. House and Room Classes:
   The House class contains instances of Room class, enabling a house to have multiple rooms.

3. Computer and Monitor Classes:
   The Computer class has an instance of the Monitor class, representing the monitor as a component of the computer.

4. University and Department Classes:
   The University class contains instances of Department class, allowing a university to have multiple departments.

5. Book and Author Classes:
   The Book class has an instance of the Author class, representing the author as a component of the book.

6. Wallet and Card Classes:
   The Wallet class contains instances of Card class, allowing a wallet to hold multiple cards.

7. Bank and Account Classes:
   The Bank class contains instances of Account class, enabling a bank to manage multiple accounts.

8. School and Student Classes:
   The School class contains instances of Student class, representing the students as components of the school.

9. MusicBand and Musician Classes:
   The MusicBand class contains instances of Musician class, allowing a music band to have multiple musicians.

10. Pizza and Topping Classes:
    The Pizza class contains instances of Topping class, representing the toppings as components of a pizza.

In summary, inheritance is used to establish an "is-a" relationship, where a subclass inherits properties and behaviors from a superclass, while composition establishes a "has-a" relationship, where a class contains instances of other classes as components. The choice between inheritance and composition depends on the specific relationship and the desired flexibility and code reuse in your program.
