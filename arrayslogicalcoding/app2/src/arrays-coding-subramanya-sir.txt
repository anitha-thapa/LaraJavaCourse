* in array index always start from Zero,in each block 4 bytes will be there
* so if we create 10 blocks then 40 bytes will be there continuously
*int[]arr1=new int[10];   syntax of arrya logical coding
*array demands 40 bytes cintinously  for above array creation
*for one block we store 4 bytes 
*ASCII is a 7bit code
*in ASCII, there are 128 symbols including capital letters, small letters, numbers
* system can take minimum 8bit
*In java, 1byte = 8bits, java follows unicode format, java has 65000 symbols
*java requires minimum 2 bytes
*c++ requires minimum 1 byte
