    				       										STATIC

*Process of static

1.loading with default values
2.initialization
3.execution from top to bottom

*exit(0)-it will terminate the class
In exit(0)- there must be a value
exit()-compilation error


*to terminate the class file we use exit(0)

*Many classes can be use in class file


*In java file der must be 0 or 1 public cls, if der it must be the java file name

*execution depend on which class have main method

*while compiling class having two classes then it will 2 class file are generated

*if we have two non public class then we can assign any name to file

* if any one class  also public then that file name must be public class name

*if both class are public then compile error will be der

*while running a class we need run the main method class

example:class K1
{
}
class L1
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
	}
}

o/p-D:\practice\app3\src>javac -d ../classes K1.java

D:\practice\app3\src>java -cp ../classes K1 ....HERE WE HAVE CLASS HAVING MAIN METHOD [D:\practice\app3\src>java -cp ../classes L1-EXECUTED]

Error: Main method not found in class K1, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application

*if  cls A and B  are already executed(loaded) then if we call second time(multiple times) it will not again executed.
i.e.,if we call multiple times class A and B, if it is already executed it will execute only one time

*when we are referring one class in another class,
ex: we are  using V class  in W
V.main(args);
NOTE:  we have to  send arguments or it should be null while referring another class file otherwise error
