Oracle-11 is the best edition

Eg:create table empl (emp_id number, first_name varchar2(90), age number);

sql is a case insensitive

create table table name ( col name, varchar2-data type used for storing for string value 

varchar2(90)- varchar size should be mention 

der is no int type or double type 

,  used as a separator

every clumn should have 2  things...name of the column and data type

if value is numeric value then data type is number...it can be int or double

varchar should mention with size
